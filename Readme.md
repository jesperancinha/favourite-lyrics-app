## Introduction

---

This project is an implementation of a Favourite lyrics app.	It contains an implementation to be used as an example of Hexagonal Architecture implemented in Java and Spring.

This is a part of a series of studies I am making about DDD(Domain driven architecture)

This project is also the official support project of my article on medium:

## Settings

This application has been tested to run with Java 17. The release being used is 13.0.1.hs-adpt, which is also known as:

```bash
sdk install java 17-open
sdk use java java 17-open
```

You need to have this version installed.	I've achieved this by using [SDK-MAN](https://sdkman.io/)

Alternatively just run this script from the command line:

```shell
. ./sdk17.sh
```

You also need to run an LTS version of node JS.

I have made script for this which will automatically install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) and [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/):

```shell
. ./node16.sh
```

## How to run

```shell
make docker-clean-build-start
```
